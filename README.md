# Research-Gap-Analysis-for-Research-Articles
The most prevailing issues in the craft of research is to develop a research agenda and build the research on the development of the research gap. Most research of any endeavor is attributed to the development of the research gap, which is a primary basis in the investigation of any problem, phenomenon or scientific question. Given this accepted tenet of engagement in research, surprising in the research fraternity, we do not train researchers on how to systematically identify research gaps as basis for the investigation. This paper aims to provide a convenient and useful platform which could assist researchers in identifying the hidden patterns, hot topics, and methods in this area. Note that the most apparent advantage of this systematic review as compared to traditional narrative reviews is that it minimizes the bias frequently observed in expressing expert judgments.
 

The objective of the project “Identification of Research gap” is to obtain the
Research gap using technological knowledge flow....
• Number of articles contain multiple authors, in order to identifies research gap,
we use two major approaches: co-citation analysis and topic modelling.
• Co-citation analysis involves searching for groups of references that are
commonly cited together and citation for each article.
• Knowledge of the most cited network is of paramount importance for the last
analysis in the article.
